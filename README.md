# BunnyHide
I simple game I made in ruby as practise.

## How it works
The game creates 10 folders which contain 10 txt-files each.
The txt-files are populated with random phrases. 
One randomly selected file contains the secretive hiding bunny.
It's up to the player to find this file.

## How to play
Install Ruby and run command 
```
ruby BunnyHide.rb
```

If you don't have ruby you, can also play by running the .exe. It's safe, I promise.

Or you can build it yourself with Ocra:
